Pricing depends on a variety of factors: the nature of the application, licensing 
volume, retail price, royalty policy, amount of required technical support and/or development,
 etc. We pride ourselves on being able to map our pricing to your application model, and working
  with organizations to meet their 'cost of good sold' goals. Thus, we do not openly publish our 
licensing prices, essentially because every case that we deal with is different.

If you have any questions regarding our licensing polices or if you are interested in working

 will reach out to you as soon as possible.
